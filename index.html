        Welcome to Mark Golino's portfolio. I hope you enjoy 
        looking through my code, my experience and see how my 
        many years of AWS, infrastructure and server knowledge 
        fits perfectly into my coding experience. My goal is 
        to continue to build my DevOps experience and allow me 
        to continue to enhance my CI/CD skills to push the 
        SDLC from development to production and everything in between.
