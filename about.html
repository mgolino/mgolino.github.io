        <p>
            Throughout my 20+ years of software development and network infrastructure experience, 
            I have managed multiple teams of offshore and onshore employees and a multitude of 
            projects simultaneously. I have indepth experience in Agile SCRUM, change management 
            and first time quality initiatives in delivering software. 
            <br><br>
            I am highly capable of communicating technology initiatives to technical and non-technical 
            team members. I have over 15 years of pre-sales engineering experience and championing 
            the product/service I represent to partners and customers. I have also presented regularly 
            to investors, board of advisors, board of directors and CEO’s.
            <br><br>
            I am a confident leader who can face challenges head on, quickly assess, discuss potential 
            solutions with team members and deliver the right solutions in a client sales or back office 
            environment. I regularly read technology and business books and I am currently enrolled in 
            online courses as I am always striving to learn more and stay on top of new technology and 
            business trends. I believe in creating teams of “A” Players with a culture of
            forward thinking by making “future planning” a daily initiative.
            <br><br>
            I have M&A experience from both sides of the acquisition. I have performed due-diligence 
            for companies to be acquired and provided in-depth reports on my findings and have given 
            recommendations to proceed or not. I have also been on the receiving side of the due-diligence 
            and was part of a very successful acquisition with a large corporation which included over 
            90% retention rate for the client transitions.
